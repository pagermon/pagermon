# 0.3.0 - 2019-04-28

**Upgrade Notes:** 
This is a major release with a complete rewrite of all database queries. 

This may result in unintended or different behaviour to previous versions, in testing this has mainly been around searching. 

Upgrades are only possible from version **0.2.3**, if you are on a lower version than this, you must first upgrade to 0.2.3 then upgrade to 0.3.0 

**PLEASE ENSURE YOU TAKE A FULL BACKUP BEFORE PERFORMING THE UPGRADE** 

* Compeletly rebuilt database driver to use the [KnexJS](https://knexjs.org/) query builder. #174 @DanrwAU
    * **Upgrades of existing SQLite databases must be performed from v0.2.3**
    * Adds  **EXPERIMENTAL** support for **MySQL** - This is used at users own risk, limited testing has been performed however not recommended for production. 
    * MariaDB may also work however this has not been tested at all.
    * Conversion of existing databases is up to the user. We recommend starting a new database if you would like to switch to MySQL.
    * This is super BETA, it has been tested as best as possible but bugs WILL exist. Please report via github bugtracker.
